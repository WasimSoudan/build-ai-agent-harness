            1. Run \`npx tsc --noEmit\` when TypeScript is present
            2. Run lint, test, or build commands only if they exist in this project and are allowed by the current approval mode
            This machine has npm and npx. When AGENTS.md names a bun command, run the npm equivalent: \`npm test\`, \`npm run lint\`, \`npx tsc --noEmit\`. Do not call bun.
            3. Report exactly what you ran, what was blocked, and what was unavailable
            4. Do NOT inflate partial verification into a blanket success claim
             
            Do NOT claim "tests pass" without running them.
            Scope your claims honestly. "Verification was limited because writes were blocked" is honest.
